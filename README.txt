INTRODUCTION:

    This is a single player game. In the 3x3 grid of buttons, there are 2 bombs hidden beneth 2 buttons. 
Your goal is to click all the buttons except for the 2 buttons containing bombs. "^_^" stands for safe, and">_<" stands 
for bomb.
    If you succeed, you will be congratulated, and you can press any button to restart. If you failed due to clicking
a bomb, you will die. But still you can press any button to restart.
    There is a CHEAT mode. By LongClicking any button anytime before you succeed, the whole picture of hidden bombs will
appear. And by clicking any button, you will resume to previous state and continue to play.
    This game is called "Feeling" because the success (without cheat) depends only on your intuition ^_^
